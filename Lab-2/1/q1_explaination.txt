The call to the fork() system call returns an integer.
1. In the parent process, it returns the process id of the newly created child process. 
2. In the child process, it returns zero.

So for getting the child's id in the parent's process, we can just use to returned process id from the fork call.
In order to get the parent's id in the child's process, we can use the getppid() system call.
