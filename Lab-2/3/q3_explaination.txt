When creating a new child process, the fork() system calls copies all the variables of the parent process.
If we make changes to variables in the child process, it doesn't have any impact on the variables of the parent process and vice-versa.

That's why making changes to the global_counter variable in one process doesn't affect the variable's value in the other process.
