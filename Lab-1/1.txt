a. How many CPU and cores does the machine have?

Used command: cat /proc/cpuinfo
CPU(Socket) - 1
Cores - 2

b. What is the frequency of each CPU ?
Used command: lscpu
CPU MHz:             1541.712
CPU max MHz:         3100.0000
CPU min MHz:         400.0000

c. How much memory does your system have?
Used command: cat /proc/meminfo
MemTotal:        8064340 kB

d. How much of it is free and available? What is the difference between them?
Used command: cat /proc/meminfo
MemFree:         5515168 kB
MemAvailable:    6187680 kB
Free memory is the amount of memory which is currently not used for anything. This number should be small, because memory which is not used is simply wasted.
Available memory is the amount of memory which is available for allocation to a new process or to existing processes.

e. What is total number of user-level processes in the system?
Used command: top
Tasks: 165 total, 1 running, 163 sleeping, 1 stopped, 0 zombie.
So total number of user level processes is 165.
